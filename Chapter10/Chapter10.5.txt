• Expanded english_number. First, put in thousands; it should return 'one
thousand' instead of (the sad) 'ten hundred' and 'ten thousand' instead of 'one
hundred hundred'.
Now expand upon english_number some more. For example, put in millions
so you get 'one million' instead of 'one thousand thousand'. Then try adding billions,
trillions, and so on.
• Wedding number. How about wedding_number? It should work almost the
same as english_number, except it should insert the word and all over the
place, returning things like 'nineteen hundred and seventy and two', or however
wedding invitations are supposed to look. I’d give you more examples, but
I don’t fully understand it myself. You might need to contact a wedding
coordinator to help you. (I’m really just kidding. You don’t have to do this
one. I didn’t even do this one.)
• “Ninety-nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall.” Using english_number and your old
program on page 49, write out the lyrics to this song the right way this
time. Punish your computer: have it start at 9999. (Don’t pick a number
too large, though, because writing all of that to the screen takes your
computer quite a while. A hundred thousand bottles of beer takes some
time; and if you pick a million, you’ll be punishing yourself as well!)
