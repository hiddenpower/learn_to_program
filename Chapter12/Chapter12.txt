• One billion seconds! Find out the exact second you were born (if you can).
Figure out when you will turn (or perhaps when you did turn) one billion
seconds old. Then go mark your calendar.
• Happy birthday! Ask what year a person was born in, then the month,
and then the day. Figure out how old they are, and give them a big SPANK!
for each birthday they have had.
